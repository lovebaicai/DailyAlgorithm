'''
There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall. 
After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.
Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 â€¦, n], function of these 4 buttons are given below:Flip all the lights.
Flip lights with even numbers.Flip lights with odd numbers.Flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, â€¦
Example 1:Input: n = 1, m = 1.Output: 2Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off]
